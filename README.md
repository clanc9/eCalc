# eCalc

Calculator. Performs routine operations as well as trigonometric and exponential functions. Inputs can be entered by clicking on a button or, for digits and binary operators, by pressing the corresponding key on the keyboard. Pressing the C(lear) button erases the formula. When pressed, a back arrow button (<-, or Backspace on the keyboard) erases the last operator or operand that was entered. 

*** Uses the comma (,) as the decimal separator (European-style) ***

Programmed as an exercise in Python, April 2018.
